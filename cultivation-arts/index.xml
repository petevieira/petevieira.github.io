      <description>Questions How do we define Taiji? Origin Story  Initially the universe was without life. All was foggy and blurry, without differentiation or separation, with no extremities or ends. This state was called 无极 (wújí, no extremes) Later the existing energy divided into two extremities, 阴 (yīn) and 阳 (yáng). This polarity, or tendency to divide is called 太极 (tàijí), the Grand Ultimate or Grand extremity. This initial separation allows and causes all subsequent divisions and changes.</description>

      <description>Goals of Meditation Absence of Self  One goal is really the remove the self, the ego, the entity in the mind that identifies with things and judges things. The result would be just the energy that is in the body, that is ever-connected with all things. So how does one reach this state while trying to reach this state, which is the self that&amp;rsquo;s trying to reach the state?  Do you force a habit of non-judgment via continual meditation practice?</description>
